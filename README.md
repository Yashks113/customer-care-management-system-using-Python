Project Description: Optimizing Call Center Operations for United Airlines.   
This project focuses on improving the efficiency of United Airlines call center operations by optimizing two key metrics Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). The goal is to identify inefficiencies, reduce resolution times, and enhance customer service using data-driven insights.
Key Challenges:
•	High AHT: Some call types, like Refund Requests and Ticket Changes, have longer handling times, slowing down the resolution process.
•	High AST: During peak hours, customers experience long waiting time, leading to call abandonment and lower satisfaction.
Data Analysis:
We analyzed call data using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to identify primary reasons for customer inquiries and their impact on AHT and AST. For example, Flight Status Inquiries and Baggage Tracking account for 30% of the total call volume but have relatively low handling times (~95 seconds). These types of inquiries are ideal candidates for automation via IVR systems.
Tools & Libraries:
•	pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
•	numpy: For numerical operations.
•	matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
•	scikit-learn: For predictive modeling and insights.
•	Jupyter Notebook: For code execution and visualization.
Proposed Solutions:
•	Automation: Implementing IVR for frequent, simple inquiries could reduce call volume by 10-15%.
•	Dynamic Staffing: Adjusting agent availability during peak hours can lower AST by 20-30%.
•	Agent Training: Reducing silence during calls and streamlining agent workflows can cut AHT by 15-20%.
Impact:
These solutions lead to significant improvements in call center efficiency, reduce customer wait times, and enhance overall satisfaction.
This project demonstrates how data insights and Python-based tools can help optimize call center performance, benefiting both customers and operational efficiency.
The provided code performs various data analyses and visualizations on call center data, focusing on metrics like Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). Here’s how you can run the code:
data insights :-
1. Optimize Call Reasons with High AHT and AST
Insight:
From the data, we observe that specific call reasons, such as "Refund Requests" and "Ticket Changes", have the highest AHT (620 seconds and 580 seconds respectively). Similarly, these reasons also have longer AST, often due to complex issue handling that requires agent assistance.
Solution:
Automate & Streamline High-AHT Call Reasons
•	Action:
o	Upgrade IVR for Complex Requests: Incorporate advanced IVR capabilities to automate tasks such as checking refund statuses or modifying ticket bookings. For example, a customer seeking a refund should be able to complete this task via IVR or be directed to a specialized refund agent.
o	Simplify Agent Processes: For calls that do require human intervention, use decision trees and dynamic agent prompts to guide agents through resolutions faster. Agents handling "Refund Requests" could be shown all refund statuses and triggers to immediately inform customers without needing multiple steps.
Outcome:
•	Reduced AHT for refund- and booking-related calls by automating or streamlining the handling of such queries.
•	A 10-20% reduction in AHT for specific call types is expected by automating the handling of these complex but repetitive issues. This can reduce AHT from 620 seconds to 496 seconds for refunds and 580 seconds to 464 seconds for ticket change.
•	This will Improved customer satisfaction for common issues as wait and resolution times decrease.

2. Manage Peak Time Call Volumes to Lower AST
Insight:
Call volumes peak during certain times, typically in the morning (9:00 AM - 11:00 AM) and afternoon (3:00 PM - 5:00 PM), causing AST to spike by 25% during these hours. The increased call volume leads to long waiting times, with customers experiencing longer queues and higher call abandonment rates.
AST data shows average waiting times of 30 seconds during off-peak hours, while peak hours push the AST to around 50 seconds or more. Increasing agent capacity during these peak hours can normalize AST to a more reasonable level, closer to off-peak times.
Solution:
Dynamic Staffing & Resource Allocation
•	Action:
o	Dynamic Staffing: Adjust agent schedules to ensure higher availability during peak hours, particularly in the morning and afternoon windows. By reallocating resources to these times, customers will experience shorter wait times (AST).
o	Promote Off-Peak Self-Service: Encourage customers to use IVR or self-service tools during peak periods by notifying them of high wait times and providing self-service alternatives
Outcome:
•	Reducing AST by having more agents available during busy periods can decrease customer wait times by up to 40%. This will also reduce abandonment rates and improve customer satisfaction during peak hours.
•	This can have an overall impact of 20% overall reduction in AST, as wait times are better managed during peak hours and 10% reduction in call abandonment rates due to shorter waiting times.

3. Train Agents to Reduce Silence and Improve Efficiency
Insight:
The data reveals a strong correlation between call silence and AHT, where the percentage of silence (moments of inactivity during a call) exceeds 20% in many cases with longer AHT (over 500 seconds). Lower sentiment scores are also observed during calls with high silence percentages, indicating dissatisfaction.
Calls related to "Refund Requests" have 20-25% silence on average, contributing to longer AHT and lower sentiment scores. By reducing silence through better agent tools, we can directly improve call handling speed and customer satisfaction.
Solution:
Real-time Support for Agents to Minimize Silence
•	Action:
o	Enhance Agent Training: Provide focused training on the most frequent call types (e.g., ticket changes or refunds), and equip agents with faster access to information through a knowledge base to avoid pauses during calls.
o	Real-time Feedback and Prompts: Implement real-time feedback mechanisms that monitor call silence and provide agents with prompts during periods of inactivity. Agents can be trained to engage customers better, reducing dead time and keeping them informed.
Outcome:
•	A reduction in silence will directly lower AHT by 10-15% for calls with high silence rates. 10%-20% improvement can expected as Customer sentiment will improve as agents maintain a more engaged and efficient communication flow.

4. Expand IVR Capabilities to Handle Frequent, Simple Inquiries
Insight:
•	Frequent, repetitive issues like "Flight Status Inquiries" and "Baggage Tracking" account for a significant portion of the call volume but are relatively simple and do not require agent involvement. These calls show AHT of less than 100 seconds, but they still consume agent time. For example, Flight Status Inquiries make up 15% of total calls, with an average AHT of 95 seconds. These could be fully automated within the IVR system, allowing customers to check their flight status or baggage without an agent’s help.
Solution:
Upgrade IVR to Handle Repetitive Call Reasons
•	Action:
o	Enhance IVR Capabilities: Build out the IVR to handle common inquiries like flight status or baggage tracking independently. Integrate real-time flight data and baggage tracking systems into the IVR so customers can access this information without needing to speak to an agent. 
o	Promote IVR Use: Proactively guide customers to the IVR through email notifications, app notifications, and text messages that encourage self-service for basic inquiries.
Outcome:
•	Reducing 80-90% of flight status and baggage tracking inquiries with the IVR can lower call volumes by 10-15%, leading to shorter wait times (AST) and freeing up agents for more complex calls, thus improving overall call center efficiency.

5. Address Call Abandonment by Reducing AST
Insight:
Longer AST correlates with higher call abandonment rates. The data shows that when AST exceeds 8 seconds, abandonment rates increase by 30%, particularly for issues like "Booking Issues" and "Refund Requests". 
For example, The "Booking Issues" category shows AST exceeding 10 seconds for 30% of the calls, with a corresponding abandonment rate of 28%.
Solution:
Implement Callback Options & Queue Transparency
•	Action:
o	Callback Feature: Introduce a callback option for customers waiting in long queues. This feature allows them to request a callback at a more convenient time rather than waiting on hold for an extended period.
o	Queue Time Transparency: Inform customers of their estimated wait time within the IVR and offer alternatives such as self-service or the callback option if the wait is too long.
Outcome:
•	A 20-30% reduction in abandonment rates can be expected by implementing callback and queue transparency features. 10-15% reduction in overall AST, as fewer customers abandon calls, and those in the queue are more informed and willing to wait. Improved resolution rates, as abandoned calls that would have needed escalation will now be handled efficiently. This will improve overall customer satisfaction by providing them with alternatives to waiting.

6. Improve Sentiment by Addressing Silence and AST
Insight:
•	The correlation matrix shows that longer AST and high silence percentages are linked to lower customer sentiment scores. Calls with high silence (20-25%) and AST over 10 seconds show the lowest sentiment scores, indicating customer frustration. By addressing these factors, both customer sentiment and satisfaction will improve. 
•	For example, calls with more than 15% silence tend to have a sentiment score drop by 1.2 points.
Solution:
Actively Manage Silence and Provide Transparent Wait Times
•	Action:
o	Real-time Monitoring of Silence: Set up a system that actively monitors call silence and informs agents when silence exceeds a certain threshold. This can prompt the agent to re-engage the customer, keeping the conversation flowing.
o	Queue Transparency: Make sure customers know their estimated wait time in the queue and offer alternatives if wait times are long.
Outcome:
•	5-10% Improved sentiment scores by addressing silence and long wait times, directly resulting in higher customer satisfaction levels and reduced escalation rates.
