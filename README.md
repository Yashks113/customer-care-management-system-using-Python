Project Description: Optimizing Call Center Operations for United Airlines.   
This project focuses on improving the efficiency of United Airlines call center operations by optimizing two key metrics Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). The goal is to identify inefficiencies, reduce resolution times, and enhance customer service using data-driven insights.
Key Challenges:
•	High AHT: Some call types, like Refund Requests and Ticket Changes, have longer handling times, slowing down the resolution process.
•	High AST: During peak hours, customers experience long waiting time, leading to call abandonment and lower satisfaction.
Data Analysis:
We analyzed call data using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to identify primary reasons for customer inquiries and their impact on AHT and AST. For example, Flight Status Inquiries and Baggage Tracking account for 30% of the total call volume but have relatively low handling times (~95 seconds). These types of inquiries are ideal candidates for automation via IVR systems.
Tools & Libraries:
•	pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
•	numpy: For numerical operations.
•	matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
•	scikit-learn: For predictive modeling and insights.
•	Jupyter Notebook: For code execution and visualization.
Proposed Solutions:
•	Automation: Implementing IVR for frequent, simple inquiries could reduce call volume by 10-15%.
•	Dynamic Staffing: Adjusting agent availability during peak hours can lower AST by 20-30%.
•	Agent Training: Reducing silence during calls and streamlining agent workflows can cut AHT by 15-20%.
Impact:
These solutions lead to significant improvements in call center efficiency, reduce customer wait times, and enhance overall satisfaction.
This project demonstrates how data insights and Python-based tools can help optimize call center performance, benefiting both customers and operational efficiency.
